# duplicatebookmarkeraser
A simple duplicate bookmark eraser for Google Chrome Extension plugin.

# Description
A popup chrome extension that automatically searches for your duplicate bookmarks based on bookmark's URL and ID. It pre-aranges and pre-default selected the excess redundant bookmarks, leaving only one copy of the bookmark. You can select or deselect options though.

I have searched for duplicate bookmark remover but none satisfied my criteria. Others are not as easy to use (though have very good UI) and requires redundant deletion. This is a seamless algorithm that finds duplicates, displays it on screen seemlessly, and then deletes it per selection.

Limitations are that I did not focus on the UI and therefore this has no icons, etc. but the algorithm excels most of other available duplicate bookmark erasers.

I have put the source in https://github.com/gerarldlee/duplicatebookmarkeraser
